## ?? **CROSS-THREAD FIX APPLIED**

I've fixed the cross-thread error that was preventing real subs from working:

### **The Problem:**
```
? Cross-thread operation not valid: Control '' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.
```

### **The Fix:**
- ? **All effect manager calls** now properly marshaled to UI thread
- ? **No more background thread errors**
- ? **Real subs will now trigger effects** just like test buttons

### **Expected Behavior After Fix:**
```
?? REAL SUB: YourName gifted 1 subscription!
? Processing single sub from YourName
EffectManager.HandleTwitchSubscription: User=YourName, Tier=Tier1, Count=1
EffectManager: About to execute effect CHAOS EMOTE (RandomImage)
? [Effect appears on screen successfully - NO ERRORS!]
```
