## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Engine Detection Logic
```csharp
// Unity Games (Blue Background)
- Process names containing: "melody", "memory"
- Window titles containing: "melody of memory", "kh melody"

// UE4 Games (White Background)  
- KH3: "kingdom hearts iii", "kh3"
- KH 0.2: "0.2 birth by sleep", "2.8"

// Square Enix Proprietary (Red Background)
- ReCoM: "re_chain", "chain of memories"
- Classic KH: "final mix", "khfm", "kh1", "kh2"
- DDD: "dream drop", "ddd"
- BBS: "birth by sleep" (excluding 0.2)
```

### Suspension Techniques

#### Unity-Compatible Suspension (100% Thread + Audio Stopping)
1. Store main window handle for restoration
2. Minimize window to remove focus
3. Hide window completely to stop rendering/audio
4. Set process priority to Idle
5. Suspend 100% of process threads
6. No focus stealing to prevent interference

#### UE4 Thread Suspension (Enhanced Focus)
1. Full thread suspension with priority adjustment
2. 100ms initialization delay after resume
3. Multi-attempt focusing with retry logic
4. Enhanced window activation sequence

#### Square Enix Priority-Only (Gentle)
1. Priority adjustment only (Normal ↔ Idle)
2. No thread suspension to prevent crashes
3. Minimal intervention approach
4. Maintains game stability

### Window Operations Sequence
1. **Target Resume**: Engine-appropriate resume technique
2. **Window Activation**: ShowWindow, SendMessage, SetForegroundWindow
3. **Borderless Conversion**: Style manipulation for fullscreen experience
4. **Enhanced Focusing**: Multi-attempt focusing with validation
5. **Background Suspension**: Suspend all other games efficiently
